# Scrapy Web Scraper
This Python script provides a simple web scraping solution using Scrapy, a powerful web crawling and scraping framework. It extracts data from a webpage and exports it to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3 
- Scrapy (can be installed via pip: pip install scrapy)

## Usage
#### Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository using the following command: git clone https://github.com/AllFruitsRipe/WebScraper-V1-.git

#### Navigate to the Directory:

Navigate to the directory using the following command: cd your_repository

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository. Once in the directory, you can proceed to update the Spider.


#### Update the Spider:

The Spider file contains the logic for extracting data from the target webpage. In the context of Scrapy, a Spider is a class that defines how a particular website (or a group of websites) will be scraped, including how to start the scraping process, which URLs to follow, and how to extract data from the web pages.

You'll need to update the Spider file (spiders/spidey.py) to specify the URL of the website you want to scrape and define the XPath notation to extract the desired data. XPath is a query language used for navigating XML documents and is commonly used in web scraping to locate specific elements on a webpage.

After opening the Spider file, locate the placeholders 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant' and '//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div[1]/p[2]' and replace them with the appropriate values. Replace 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant' with the URL of the website you want to scrape, and replace '//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div[1]/p[2]' with the XPath notation that corresponds to the data you want to extract from the webpage.

Once you've updated the Spider file with the relevant information, save the changes and proceed to run the Spider.

- Open the spiders/spidey.py file.
- Replace 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant' with the URL of the website you want to scrape.
- Replace '//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div[1]/p[2]' with the appropriate XPath notation to extract the desired data.
  
#### Run the Spider:

Run the Spider using the following command: scrapy crawl Spidey

#### Export Data to CSV:

The extracted data can be found in the CSV file generated by the scraper. By default, the CSV file is named first_scrape.csv.

## Features:
- Easy Configuration: The scraper is easy to configure and customize. You can specify the target URL and define XPath expressions to extract specific data elements from the webpage.

- Data Extraction: Using XPath notation, the scraper extracts data from the target webpage. You can define the XPath expressions in the spider file to specify which elements of the webpage to scrape.

- CSV Export: Extracted data is exported to a CSV file named first_scrape.csv. This file contains the scraped data in a structured format, making it easy to analyze and manipulate using spreadsheet software or other tools.

- Customization: You can easily customize the scraper to scrape data from different websites or extract different types of information. Simply modify the spider file (spiders/spidey.py) to adjust the scraping logic according to your requirements.



## Why I Created It

#### Data Collection Needs:
- The project required a large volume of data from various websites to perform analysis, research, or other tasks.

#### Customization:
- Existing datasets or APIs did not provide the required data in the desired format or granularity. Building a custom web scraper allowed me to extract exactly the information needed.

#### Automation:
- Manually collecting data from websites is time-consuming and impractical for large-scale projects. By automating the data extraction process with a web scraper, I can save time and effort.



## How I Created It

#### Framework Selection: 
I chose Scrapy due to its robust features, scalability, and flexibility. Scrapy provides powerful tools for web scraping, such as XPath and CSS selectors for data extraction, built-in support for handling pagination and asynchronous requests, and convenient pipeline for data processing.

#### Spider Development:
I developed a Spider class in Scrapy, defining the target website(s), specifying how to start the scraping process, and implementing logic to extract desired data from the web pages. This involved writing XPath or CSS selectors to locate and extract specific elements from the HTML structure of the web pages.

#### Pipeline Setup: 
I configured Scrapy pipelines to process the extracted data, perform any necessary cleaning or transformation, and store it in the desired format (e.g., CSV, JSON, database).

#### Testing and Refinement: 
I tested the web scraper to ensure it functions correctly and captures the intended data accurately. I iteratively refined the scraper's logic and selectors based on test results and observed data.

#### Execution: 
Once satisfied with the scraper's performance, I executed it to crawl the target websites, extract the required data, and store it for further analysis or integration into my project.
