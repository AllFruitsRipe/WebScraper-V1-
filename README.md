# Scrapy Web Scraper
This Python script provides a simple web scraping solution using Scrapy, a powerful web crawling and scraping framework. It extracts data from a webpage and exports it to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3 
- Scrapy (can be installed via pip: pip install scrapy)

## Usage
#### Clone the Repository:

Copy code : git clone [https://github.com/AllFruitsRipe/WebScraper-V1-.git]

#### Navigate to the Directory:

Copy code: cd your_repository

#### Update the Spider:

- Open the spiders/spidey.py file.
- Replace 'INSERT_URL_HERE' with the URL of the website you want to scrape.
- Replace 'XPATH_NOTATION_HERE' with the appropriate XPath notation to extract the desired data.
  
#### Run the Spider:

Copy code: scrapy crawl Spidey

#### Export Data to CSV:

The extracted data will be saved in a CSV file named first_scrape.csv.

## Features:
- Easy Configuration: The scraper is easy to configure and customize. You can specify the target URL and define XPath expressions to extract specific data elements from the webpage.

- Data Extraction: Using XPath notation, the scraper extracts data from the target webpage. You can define the XPath expressions in the spider file to specify which elements of the webpage to scrape.

- CSV Export: Extracted data is exported to a CSV file named first_scrape.csv. This file contains the scraped data in a structured format, making it easy to analyze and manipulate using spreadsheet software or other tools.

- Customization: You can easily customize the scraper to scrape data from different websites or extract different types of information. Simply modify the spider file (spiders/spidey.py) to adjust the scraping logic according to your requirements.
